# A Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Sending Emails with Nodemailer in NodeJS

Welcome to a beginner's guide to Sending Emails using Nodemailer in NodeJS with Google API and Google OAuth 2.0!

This project serves as a comprehensive guide, offering testing and implementation insights for sending emails using Nodemailer in NodeJS with Google API and Google OAuth 2.0.

## Introduction

This project leverages Nodemailer with Google API and OAuth 2.0 to create a secure email-sending service. Using OAuth 2.0 for authentication ensures both efficiency and data protection for automated emails or newsletters.

This project's functionalities include:

- Sending emails using Google Apps.
- Sending emails using Ethereal Testing Server.
- Sending an embed image and a text file email with Google Apps.
- Sending (an embed image and a text file) email with Google API and Google OAuth 2.0.

## Getting Started

I recommend running this project on **NodeJS v20+** or **NodeJS v22+**. This project was originally running on **NodeJS v21.7.1**.

### Installation

To get started, you need to download this project from Github and navigate to the project's folder.

```sh
cd crewai-mysql-gen-cli/
```

Dowloading the project's dependencies from `requirements.txt` file.

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

I also have a [link](https://chatgpt.com/share/757c50b4-f574-48d0-a04d-c955d100aeab) to support you in this process.

### Environment Variable

This step is **important**! Create an `.env` file to store your API KEY(s). These are the API KEY(s) you will need. Currently, in this project, I am using GroqAI API but you can change it to any LLM(s) you prefer.

```sh
GROQ_API=""
```

## Quick Start

The main functions are located in `main.py` and there are databases provided in the repository. Run the project using the following command(s).

```sh
python main.py
```

Inside `main.py`, there are 2 crews, these are for the 2 main functions of this project, you can comment out the function you don't want to run.

```sh
print(">>> Question Suggest Program starts!")
output = query_suggest_crew.kickoff()
print(">>> Question Suggest Answer:")
print(output)
# print(">>> Program 2 starts!")
# output = mysql_crew.kickoff()
# print(">>> Answer:")
# print(output)
# print(">>> MySQL code block only:")
# print(mysql_generate_task.output.raw_output)
```

You can provide your own databases in the `mysql_db_schemas/` directory. You can load them in `main.py` by changing the file path.

```sh
filepath = "./mysql_db_schemas/{your-database-name}.sql"
```

### 13/09/2024

- Initialize: database utils
- Testing: `raw` vs `raw_output`
- Testing: modular design with CrewAI
- Testing: using `raw_output` with modular design

### 12/09/2024

- CrewAI is built upon LangChain, so CrewAI can use LangChain functions and tools (at least some of it).

  - https://docs.crewai.com/.

- In CrewAI, there 4 components that are important, they are `Agent()`, `Task()`, `Process()` and `Crew()`. However, only `Agent()`, `Task()` and `Process()` are worth keeping an eye on.

  - `Process()`: There are 2 types of process being **sequential** and **hierarchy**. However, it's **sequential** by defaultt.

  - `Agent()`: Initialize and declare your LLMs to use in the task.

  - `Task()`: This is the most important part. `Task()` is where most of the process' tasks are done. The output of 1 task is automatically used as the input of the next task but you can use the `context` keyword to force this flow. The `context` keyword is also used to dictate which tasks will be used as input of another task.

    - The output of 1 task is automatically used as the input of the next one. However, you can specify which task(s)
      should be used in another task, this could lead to 1 task using multiple tasks for its context. An `Agent` can be used by multiple `Task`(s) but those `Task`(s) must be performing the same operation. For example, `analyze_agent` can be used by both `business_analyze` and `market_analyze` because they perform the same operation, but `image_generate` cannot.

  - `Crew()`: This is where you will assemble your agents and tasks (list which agents and tasks are used in the process). The order in which the tasks are placed in `Crew()` will be the order that the tasks will perform (because it's **sequential** by default). Because the important components are the tasks not the agents, this means you can have a dispoportion for the agents and the tasks where an agent are used to perform for 2 tasks. `Crew()` is not that important, it's just a collection that house agents and tasks.

- In the CrewAI docs, these are the sections you need to view:

  - From `Core Concepts`: Agent, Task, Process, Crew and Tool (maybe)

  - From `How to Guides`: Sequential Process Overview -> Implementing Sequential Process and Hierarchical Process Overview (maybe)

  - From `Examples`: Look over some example code and you will see some a crew that have multiple task but fewer agent

### 11/09/2024

- Initialize: the 2nd initializattion of the project

### 08/08/2024

- Initialize: the project

## To Do:

- Add few-shot examples

updating...

## Notes:

- nodemon is npm i nodemon --save-dev <=> npm install <package-name> --save-dev
- https://chatgpt.com/share/877de70d-73b7-44d3-b791-cb26601db92c, client supports html will render html, client supports text will render text

## Other requirements:

You will need .env:

- BE_PORT

There is a little note to check for invalid_grant this is most often happens
